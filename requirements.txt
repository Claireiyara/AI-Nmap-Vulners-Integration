# Software Requirements
1. Python: Version 3.8 or higher.
2. Nmap: Installed on your system for network scanning.

# Python Libraries
The following Python libraries are required:

- `python-nmap`: A Python wrapper for the Nmap tool.
- `requests`: For making API calls to the Vulners API.

#python-nmap requests

To install them, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

#Environment Variables
You need to set up an environment variable for the Vulners API key to securely authenticate API calls.

#Export your API key:
export VULNERS_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

#Operating System Compatibility
This project is compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows (with Nmap installed).

#Network Permissions
Ensure you have the necessary permissions to run Nmap on your network. Some networks may block scans or require admin privileges.

#Optional: Virtual Environment (Recommended)
For better dependency management, use a Python virtual environment:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # For Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate       # For Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
